## 1 Data visualization
The graphic representation and presentation of data
- Looking at visuals in order to understand and draw conclusions about data
- Creating visuals using raw data to tell a story

People won’t always have the ability to interpret or understand the complex information that you relay to them so your job is to inform them of your analysis in a way that is meaningful, engaging, and easy to understand.

### 1.1 The David McCandless method 
Visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. 
Data in visual form without a goal or function is just a pretty picture. 
Data with a goal but no story or visual form can be boring. 
All four elements need to be present to create an effective visual.
- Information: the data with which you’re working, reflects the conclusion you’ve drawn from the data, which you will communicate with visualization
- Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept, adds meaning to the data and makes it interesting
- Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual, makes the data usable and useful
- Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression, creates both beauty and structure

### 1.2 Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts trifecta checkup
Use these questions to determine if your data visualization is effective:
- What is the practical question? 
- What does the data say?
- What does the visual say?

### 1.3 Pre-attentive attributes
The elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically and without conscious effort. 

#### 1.3.1 Marks
Marks are basic visual objects such as points, lines, and shapes. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities:
- 1. Position: Where is a specific mark in space relative to a scale or to other marks? 
- 2. Size: How big, small, long, or tall is a mark?
- 3. Shape: Does the shape of a specific object communicate something about it?
- 4. Color: What color is a mark?

#### 1.3.2 Channels
Channels are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data in a visualization.
- 1. Accuracy: Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?
- 2. Popout: How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others?
- 3. Grouping: How effective is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?

## 2 Types of visualization
What is the best way to tell the story within my data?
- Bar graphs: Use size contrast to compare two or more values
- Line charts: Used to track changes over short and long periods of time. 
  - When smaller changes exist, line charts are better to use than bar graphs.
- Combo charts
- Stacked column charts
- Pie charts: Show how much each part of something makes up the whole
  - The pie chart is a circular graph that is divided into segments representing proportions corresponding to the quantity it represents, especially when dealing with parts of a whole.
- Heatmap: Use color to compare categories in a data set.
- Scatterplot: Show relationships between different variables.
- Distribution graph: Display the spread of various outcomes in a dataset. 
- Maps: Help organize data geographically
- Time series charts
- Histogram: A chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges
- Ranked bar charts
- Correlation charts: Show relationships among data

### 2.1 Decision tree
A decision tree is a flowchart that you can use to help frame larger decisions as a series of smaller yes/no decisions.
- If you have data that has one, continuous, numerical variable, then a histogram or density plot are the best methods of plotting your categorical data. Depending on your type of data, a bar chart can even be appropriate in this case.
- For cases dealing with more than one set of data, consider a line or pie chart for accurate representation of your data. 
  - A line chart will connect multiple data sets over a single, continuous line, showing how numbers have changed over time. 
  - A pie chart is good for dividing a whole into multiple categories or parts. 
- A line chart is usually adequate for plotting trends over time. 
-  When you have two variables for one set of data, it is important to point out how one affects the other. Variables that pair well together are best plotted on a scatterplot. However, if there are too many data points, the relationship between variables can be obscured so a heat map can be a better representation in that case.

### 2.2 Best practices
- Your audience should know what they are observing within five seconds of being shown a data visualization. Visuals should be clear and easy to follow. 
- In the five seconds after that, your audience should understand the conclusion your visualization is making—even if they aren’t familiar with your research. 
- As long as it’s not misleading, you should visually represent only the data that your audience needs to understand your findings. Including irrelevant data may confuse, distract, or overwhelm your audience.


### 2.3 Patterns
- Change: This is a trend or instance of observations that become different over time. A great way to measure change in data is through a line or column chart.
- Clustering: A collection of data points with similar or different values. This is best represented through a distribution graph.
- Relativity: These are observations considered in relation or in proportion to something else. You have probably seen examples of relativity data in a pie chart.
- Ranking: This is a position in a scale of achievement or status. Data that requires ranking is best represented by a column chart.
- Correlation: This shows a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. A scatterplot is an excellent way to represent this type of data pattern.

### 2.4 Correlation and causation
- Correlation in statistics is the measure of the degree to which two variables move in relationship to each other.
- Causation: Occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome

## 3 Dynamic visualization
- Static visualizations: Don't change over time unless they're edited
- Dynamic visualizations: Visualizations that are interactive or change over time

### 3.1 Tableau
A business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data.

## 4 The elements of art
- Line
- Shape
- Color
  - Hue
  - Intensity: how bright or dull
  - Value: The color’s lightness or darkness
- Space
- Movement

## 5 Principles of design
- 1. Balance: The design of a data visualization is balanced when the key visual elements, like color and shape, are distributed evenly.
- 2. Emphasis: Your data visualization should have a focal point, so that your audience knows where to concentrate. 
- 3. Movement: Movement can refer to the path the viewer’s eye travels as they look at a data visualization, or literal movement created by animations.
- 4. Pattern: You can use similar shapes and colors to create patterns in your data visualization.
- 5. Repetition: Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization. 
- 6. Proportion: Proportion is another way that you can demonstrate the importance of certain data. 
- 7. Rhythm: This refers to creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization.
  - Rhythm is closely tied to the movement principle.
- 8. Variety: Your visualizations should have some variety in the chart types, lines, shapes, colors, and values you use. 
- 9. Unity: The last principle is unity. This means that your final data visualization should be cohesive.
