# Correlation and Causation

When you make conclusions from data analysis, you need to make sure that you don’t assume a causal relationship between elements of your data when there is only a correlation.

## 1 Cause of disease
Pellagra is a disease with symptoms of dizziness, sores, vomiting, and diarrhea. In the early 1900s, people thought that the disease was caused by unsanitary living conditions. Most people who got pellagra also lived in unsanitary environments. But, a closer examination of the data showed that pellagra was the result of a lack of niacin (Vitamin B3). Unsanitary conditions were related to pellagra because most people who couldn’t afford to purchase niacin-rich foods also couldn’t afford to live in more sanitary conditions. But, dirty living conditions turned out to be a correlation only.

## 2 Temprature and Ice cream
When your data shows that outdoor temperature and ice cream consumption both go up at the same time, it might be tempting to conclude that hot weather causes people to eat ice cream. But, a closer examination of the data would reveal that every change in temperature doesn’t lead to a change in ice cream purchases. In addition, there might have been a sale on ice cream at the same time that the data was collected, which might not have been considered in your analysis.
