# GenAI

Imagine you’re working as a data analyst at an investment bank specializing in portfolio management. Your current task is to provide recommendations for clients on adjusting their portfolios. You’ve analyzed the data and are now preparing a report for key decision-makers outlining your recommendations. 

One key data source you’re using is the S&P 500 stock market index, a significant indicator of U.S. economic health. Your report needs to explain the significance of this data to stakeholders, but you aren’t sure which type of visualization would be most helpful. To get started, you ask a gen AI tool to provide some recommendations.

As a reminder, here is the prompting framework:
- Thoughtfully: Describe your task, specifying a persona and format preference.
- Create: Include any context the gen AI tool might need to give you what you want.
- Really: Add references the gen AI tool can use to inform its output.
- Excellent: Next, evaluate the output to identify opportunities for improvement. 
- Inputs: Then, iterate on your initial prompt to attain those improvements.

In this activity, you’ll start prompting with just one part of the framework, then gradually build on it in order to identify what’s missing or unhelpful from your prompt and make the output more useful.

## 1 Enter your initial prompt

Let's start by entering a simple prompt into the generative AI tool, focusing solely on the task at hand. We'll refine and expand this prompt using the rest of the prompting framework in subsequent steps. For now, consider this example prompt that outlines what we want the tool to do:

PROMPT: I have a dataset with the daily closing prices for the stocks in a diversified portfolio over the course of the last year. Provide a list of the most applicable types of data visualizations to help me illustrate which sectors of the economy are performing best.

Remember, this initial prompt is a starting point for learning and experimentation. We'll iterate on it later to ensure it aligns with the prompting framework and produces the best possible results.

## 2 Evaluate the initial output

Review and assess the output from your initial prompt. Is the list of data visualizations accurate and unbiased? Does it include a variety of options? Are the data visualizations relevant to the financial industry and your report?

Identify ways that the output could better meet your needs, and use this assessment to guide your refinement and iteration process.

## 3 Revise and refine your prompt

Revise and refine your prompt by adding more of the prompting framework:

Add more context to help the tool provide better, more relevant results.

For example, you could: 

- Clarify what you mean by "performing best." Are you looking for highest returns, lowest volatility, or something else? This helps tailor the visualization suggestions.
- Indicate who will be viewing these visualizations. Are they financial experts or a general audience? This impacts the complexity and explanation needed.
- Give feedback on the tone you’d like to maintain.

Provide examples as references.

For example, you could:
- Mention any visualizations that you liked or found insightful. This gives the AI tool a reference point for style and approach.
- Bring up any particular sectors you want to highlight or compare. This helps focus the visualization suggestions.
- Specify if you're interested in the entire year's performance or a specific period within the year. This impacts the data range for visualizations.

Specify the format you want to receive. 

For example, you could: 
- Request a specific number of visualization types (e.g., 3-5) to ensure a concise yet varied list.
- Request a brief mention of the pros and cons of each visualization type to help you make informed choices.

When you’re ready, enter your new prompt. Alternatively, you can build on what you’ve already entered by issuing follow-up requests and engaging in a dialogue with the AI tool.

## 4 Evaluate the output again

Review the output again and assess what information you might still need. Are there any other parts of the prompting framework that you can include next time, or opportunities to add more detail or nuance? If so, continue to prompt.

## 5 Take an iterative approach

Continue repeating steps 3 and 4 until you feel confident that the output meets your goals. For example, is the list of data visualizations long enough to give you useful choices for creating your report? Are the recommendations relevant for a financial report? Will they help you present your data in the most impactful way?

This exercise, along with the lesson videos, offer examples of how generative AI can streamline your daily tasks. Now, experiment with your preferred generative AI tool to discover how it can support your specific responsibilities as a data analyst.
