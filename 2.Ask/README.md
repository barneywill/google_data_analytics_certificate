## 1 Structured thinking
The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.


## 2 Common problem types
| |Type|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|1|Making predictions|Using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future|
|2|Categorizing things|Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features|
|3|Spotting something unusual|Identifying data that is different from the norm|
|4|Identifying themes|Grouping categorized information into broader concepts|
|5|Discovering connections|Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them|
|6|Find patterns|Using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again|

## 3 SMART questions
how to ask highly effective questions
|Item|Definition|
|---|---|
|Specific|Specific questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closedly related ideas|
|Measurable|Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed|
|Action-oriented|Action-oriented questions encourage change|
|Relevant|Relevant questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve|
|Time-bound|Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied|

### 3.1 Specific
- Is the question specific? 
- Does it address the problem? 
- Does it have context? 
- Will it uncover a lot of the information you need?

### 3.2 Measurable
- Will the question give you answers that you can measure?

### 3.3 Action-oriented
- Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of plan?

### 3.4 Relevant
- Is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve?

### 3.5 Time-bound
- Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?

### Questions to avoid
|Question|Definition|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Leading questions|it suggests an answer as part of the question|This product is too expensive, isn’t it?|
|Closed-ended questions|ask for a one-word or brief response only|Were you satisfied with the customer trial?|
|Vague questions|aren’t specific or don’t provide context|Does the tool work for you?|
