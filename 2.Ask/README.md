Skill sets to build:
- Asking SMART and effective questions
- Structuring how you think
- Summarizing data
- Putting things into context
- Managing team and stakeholder expectations
- Problem-solving and conflict-resolution

## 1 Structured thinking
The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.


## 2 Common problem types
| |Type|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|1|Making predictions|Using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future|
|2|Categorizing things|Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features|
|3|Spotting something unusual|Identifying data that is different from the norm|
|4|Identifying themes|Grouping categorized information into broader concepts|
|5|Discovering connections|Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them|
|6|Find patterns|Using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again|

## 3 SMART questions
how to ask highly effective questions
|Item|Definition|
|---|---|
|Specific|Specific questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closedly related ideas|
|Measurable|Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed|
|Action-oriented|Action-oriented questions encourage change|
|Relevant|Relevant questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve|
|Time-bound|Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied|

### 3.1 Specific
- Is the question specific? 
- Does it address the problem? 
- Does it have context? 
- Will it uncover a lot of the information you need?

### 3.2 Measurable
- Will the question give you answers that you can measure?

### 3.3 Action-oriented
- Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of plan?

### 3.4 Relevant
- Is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve?

### 3.5 Time-bound
- Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?

### Questions to avoid
|Question|Definition|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Leading questions|it suggests an answer as part of the question|This product is too expensive, isn’t it?|
|Closed-ended questions|ask for a one-word or brief response only|Were you satisfied with the customer trial?|
|Vague questions|aren’t specific or don’t provide context|Does the tool work for you?|

## 4 Data-driven decisions vs Data-inspired decisions
|Data-driven decisions|Data-inspired decisions|
|---|---|
|using facts to guide business strategy|explores different data sources to find out what they have in common|

## 5 Quantitative data vs Qualitative data
Qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation.
|Quantitative data|Qualitative data|
|---|---|
|Specific and objective measures of numerical facts|Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics|
|What, When, How many|Why, How|

## 6 Data presentation/vasualization
| |Report|Dashboard|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|Static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically|Monitors live, incoming data|
|Pros|High-level historical data; Easy to design; Pre-cleaned and sorted data|Dynamic, automatic, and interactive; More stakeholder access; Low maintenance|
|Cons|Continual maintenance; Less visually appealing; Static|Labor-intensive design; Can be confusing, Potentially uncleaned data|

### Metric
Single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement
- ROI(Return On Investment): A formula that uses the metrics of investment and profit to evaluate the success of an investment
- Customer retention rates
- Bed occupancy rate

### Metric Goal
A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics

### 6.1 Data vasualization tools

#### 6.1 Spreadsheet
Both Sheets and Excel are go-to choices for creating static charts and graphs. They offer basic data visualization capabilities that are often enough for simple visualizations. In addition, you can use them to  clean, sort, and filter data. And both offer a range of chart types, graphing tools, and pivot tables for creating effective data visualizations. These charts are easy to manage; they update when the source data is updated, so they don’t require much manual intervention once implemented. 

##### 6.1.1 Pivot table
A pivot table is a data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, re-organize, group, count, total, or average data stored in a database.

##### 6.1.2 formula
- \+
- \-
- \*
- \/

##### 6.1.2 math functions
- sum
- avg
- count
- min
- max

#### 6.2 Tableau
Tableau is used to create powerful and interactive visualizations, making it an excellent choice for data visualizations such as live dashboards. Tableau also makes it easy to create charts, graphs, and dashboards in a drag-and-drop interface. The application  supports a wide range of data sources and provides advanced analytics capabilities. These features allow for in-depth exploration of data trends and patterns.

##### 6.2.1 Dashboard
A tool that monitors live, incoming data
- Track historical and current performance.
- Establish both long-term and/or short-term goals.
- Define key performance indicators or metrics.
- Identify potential issues or points of inefficiency.

| |Strategic dashboards|Operational dashboards|Analytical dashboards|
|---|---|---|---|
|Definition|to evaluate and align their strategic goals|to track and maintain their immediate operational processes in light of their strategic goals|identifies and tracks the various KPIs that may be used to assess strategic and operational goals|
|Timeframe|provide information over the longest time frame—from a single financial quarter to years|contain information on a time scale of days, weeks, or months|skips a specific timeframe|
||||usually created and maintained by data science teams and rarely shared with upper management as they can be very difficult to understand|

## 7 Big Data
Large, complex datasets typically involving long periods of time, which enable data analysts to address far-reaching business problems 
|4V|Definition|
|---|---|
|Volume|The amount of data| 
|Variety|The different kinds of data | 
|Velocity|How fast the data can be processed|
