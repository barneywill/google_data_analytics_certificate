## 1 Structured thinking
The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.

Analysts identify and formalize quantifiable project requirements by using structured thinking to ask clarifying questions, define what to accomplish, and specify project boundaries.

## 2 Common problem types
| |Type|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|1|Making predictions|Using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future|
|2|Categorizing things|Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features|
|3|Spotting something unusual|Identifying data that is different from the norm|
|4|Identifying themes|Grouping categorized information into broader concepts|
|5|Discovering connections|Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them|
|6|Find patterns|Using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again|

### Problem domain
The specific area of analysis that encompases every activity affecting or affected by the problem

## 3 SMART questions
how to ask highly effective questions
|Item|Definition|
|---|---|
|Specific|Specific questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closedly related ideas|
|Measurable|Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed|
|Action-oriented|Action-oriented questions encourage change|
|Relevant|Relevant questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve|
|Time-bound|Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied|

### 3.1 Specific
- Is the question specific? 
- Does it address the problem? 
- Does it have context? 
- Will it uncover a lot of the information you need?

### 3.2 Measurable
- Will the question give you answers that you can measure?

### 3.3 Action-oriented
- Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of plan?

### 3.4 Relevant
- Is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve?

### 3.5 Time-bound
- Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?

Why is it important to create SMART questions about your datasets? How do these questions benefit your work as a data professional?

### Questions to avoid
|Question|Definition|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Leading questions|it suggests an answer as part of the question|This product is too expensive, isn’t it?|
|Closed-ended questions|ask for a one-word or brief response only|Were you satisfied with the customer trial?|
|Vague questions|aren’t specific or don’t provide context|Does the tool work for you?|

## 4 Scope of work(SOW)
An agreed-upon outline of the tasks to be performed during a project

A scope of work is project-based and sets the expectations and boundaries of a project.
| |Area|Definition|
|---|---|---|
|1|Deliverables|items or tasks you will complete before you can finish the project.|
|2|Timeline|include due dates for when deliverables, milestones, and/or reports are due.|
|3|Milestones|significant tasks you will confirm along your timeline to help everyone know the project is on track.|
|4|Reports|notify everyone as you finalize deliverables and meet milestones.|

### 4.1 Deliverables
Use numbers and aim for hard, measurable goals and objectives.
- What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project? 
- When the project is complete, what are you expected to deliver to the stakeholders? Be specific here. 
- Will you collect data for this project? 
- How much, or for how long? 

### 4.2 Milestones 
closely related to timeline
- What are the major milestones for progress in your project? 
- How do you know when a given part of the project is considered complete? 

### 4.3 Timeline
closely tied to the milestones
- When will the deliverables be completed? 
- How long do you expect the project will take to complete? 
- If all goes as planned, how long do you expect each component of the project will take? 
- When can we expect to reach each milestone?

### 4.4 Reports
- How will you communicate progress with stakeholders and sponsors, and how often? 
- Will progress be reported weekly? Monthly? 
- When milestones are completed? 
- What information will status reports contain?

Why is it important to determine your SMART questions and answers before crafting an SOW?

The SOW is mostly an organizational tool to help analysts make effective and impactful decisions. It’s about being technical by taking the same steps each time to make sure the analyst acts with intention. Being able to describe your process and the methods highlights your ability to be thorough, follow through on projects, and apply effective frameworks to your work.

## 5 Data-driven decisions vs Data-inspired decisions
|Data-driven decisions|Data-inspired decisions|
|---|---|
|using facts to guide business strategy|explores different data sources to find out what they have in common|

## 6 Quantitative data vs Qualitative data
Qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation.
|Quantitative data|Qualitative data|
|---|---|
|Specific and objective measures of numerical facts|Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics|
|What, When, How many|Why, How|

## 7 Data presentation/vasualization
| |Report|Dashboard|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|Static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically|Monitors live, incoming data|
|Pros|High-level historical data; Easy to design; Pre-cleaned and sorted data|Dynamic, automatic, and interactive; More stakeholder access; Low maintenance|
|Cons|Continual maintenance; Less visually appealing; Static|Labor-intensive design; Can be confusing, Potentially uncleaned data|

### Metric
Single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement
- ROI(Return On Investment): A formula that uses the metrics of investment and profit to evaluate the success of an investment
- Customer retention rates
- Bed occupancy rate
- Turnover rate: The rate at which employees voluntarily leave a company

### Metric Goal
A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics

### 7.1 Data vasualization tools

#### 7.1 Spreadsheet
Both Sheets and Excel are go-to choices for creating static charts and graphs. They offer basic data visualization capabilities that are often enough for simple visualizations. In addition, you can use them to  clean, sort, and filter data. And both offer a range of chart types, graphing tools, and pivot tables for creating effective data visualizations. These charts are easy to manage; they update when the source data is updated, so they don’t require much manual intervention once implemented. 

##### 7.1.1 Pivot table
A pivot table is a data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, re-organize, group, count, total, or average data stored in a database.

##### 7.1.2 formula
A formula is a set of instructions used to perform a calculation using the data in a spreadsheet.
- \+
- \-
- \*
- \/

###### Error
- #DIV/0!: A formula is trying to divide a value in a cell by 0 (or an empty cell with no value)
- #ERROR!: Something can’t be interpreted as it has been input. This is also known as a parsing error. often due to incompatible data types
- #N/A: A formula can't find the data. The cell being referenced can't be found. The name of a function is misspelled  
- #NAME?: The name of a formula or function used isn't recognized
- #NUM!: The spreadsheet can't perform a formula calculation because a cell has an invalid numeric value
- #REF!: A formula is referencing a cell that isn't valid. A cell used in a formula was in a column that was deleted
- #VALUE!: A general error indicating a problem with a formula or with referenced cells, often due to incompatible data types

##### 7.1.2 function
A function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet.
- sum
- average
- count
- min
- max
- countif: COUNTIF('raw data'!G:G,A2)
- vlookup: VLOOKUP(G3,\$B\$4:\$D\$8,3,FALSE)
- datedif: DATEDIF(B2,C2,"M")
- text: TEXT(B2,"mmmm")
- importrange: IMPORTRANGE("https://docs.google.com/thisisatestabc123", "sheet1!A1:F13")
- importhtml
- importdata

#### 7.2 Tableau
Tableau is used to create powerful and interactive visualizations, making it an excellent choice for data visualizations such as live dashboards. Tableau also makes it easy to create charts, graphs, and dashboards in a drag-and-drop interface. The application  supports a wide range of data sources and provides advanced analytics capabilities. These features allow for in-depth exploration of data trends and patterns.

## 9 Needs vs Expectations
Balance

### 9.1 Stakeholder
Stakeholders are people who have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you are  working on.
|Stakeholder|Role|Characteristic|
|---|---|---|
|Executive team|provides strategic and operational leadership to the company|less interested in the details|
|Customer-facing team|has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers|have their own objectives and may come to you with specific asks|
|Data science team|Organizing data within a company takes teamwork.|data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers|

### 9.2 Working effectively with stakeholders
communicate clearly, establish trust, and deliver your findings across groups.
- Discuss goals
- Feel empowered to say “no.”: communicate clearly, establish trust, and deliver your findings across groups.
- Plan for the unexpected: make a list of potential roadblocks
- Know your project: how your project connects to the rest of the company
- Start with words and visuals: illusion of agreement
- Communicate often: regular updates on your projects about project milestones, setbacks, and changes

### 9.3 Focus on what matters
- Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders? and their goals?
- Who is managing the data?
- Where can you go for help?

### 9.4 Communication effectively
- Who your audience is
- What they already know
- What they need to know
- How you can communicate that effectively to them

### 9.5 Conflict resolution
From conflict to collaboration
- Reframe the problem: Restating a problem or challenge, then redirecting it toward a potential resolution
- Discussion: start a conversation
- Understand the context
