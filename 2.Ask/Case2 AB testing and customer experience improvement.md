### A/B testing

A/B testing is a simple example of collecting data for data-driven decision-making. For example, a website that sells widgets has an idea for a new website layout they think will result in more people buying widgets. For two weeks, half of their website visitors are directed to the old site; the other half are directed to the new site. After those two weeks, the analyst gathers the data about their website visitors and the number of widgets sold for analysis. This helps the analyst understand which website layout resulted in more widget sales. If the new website performed better in producing widget sales, then the company can confidently make the decision to use the new layout!

## 2 Data-inspired decisions

### Customer experience improvement

A customer support center gathers customer satisfaction data (often known as a “CSAT” score). They use a simple 1–10 score along with a qualitative description in which the customer describes their experience. The customer support center manager wants to improve customer experience, so they set a goal to improve the CSAT score. They start by analyzing the CSAT scores and reading each of the descriptions from the customers. Additionally, they interview the people working in the customer support center. From there, the manager formulates a strategy and decides what needs to improve the most in order to raise customer satisfaction scores. While the manager certainly relies on the CSAT data in the decision-making process, input of support center representatives and other qualitative information informs the approach as well.
