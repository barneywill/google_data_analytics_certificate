## 1 Examples
What features do people look for when buying a new car?
- Specific: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?
- Measurable: Does the question include a feature rating system?
- Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?
- Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?
- Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years? 

Questions:
- On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive? Explain.
- What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?
- What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?
- How does a car having four-wheel drive contribute to its value, in your opinion?

## 2 Scenario
You are three weeks into your new job as a junior data analyst. The company you work for has just collected data on their weekend sales. Your manager asks you to perform a thorough exploration of this data. To get this project started, you must ask some questions and get some information.

You can apply the SMART framework to all types of questions. The type of questions you ask can help you explore deeper with your data. Consider the ways your questions help you examine objectives, audience, time, security, and resources.

Some common topics for questions include: 
- Objectives
- Audience
- Time
- Resources
- Security

Think about how you can ask SMART questions about each of these topics.

Consider the scenario above:
- Based on the SMART framework, which questions are most important to ask? 
- How will these questions clarify the requirements and goals for the project?
- How does asking detailed, specific questions benefit you when planning for a project? Can vague or unclear questions harm a project?


Here are a few questions you might want to ask:
- When is the project due?
- Are there any specific challenges to keep in mind? 
- Who are the major stakeholders for this project, and what do they expect this project to do for them?
- Who am I presenting the results to?

Here are some examples of questions you might ask based on the suggested topics:
- Objectives: What are the goals of the deep dive? What, if any, questions are expected to be answered by this deep dive?
- Audience: Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who is the audience for the presentation?
- Time: What is the time frame for completion? By what date does this need to be done?
- Resources: What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?
- Security: Who should have access to the information?

These questions can help you focus on techniques and analyses that produce results of interest to stakeholders. They also clarify the deliverable’s due date, which is important to know so you can manage your time effectively. When you start work on a project, you need to ask questions that align with the plan and the goals and help you explore the data. The more questions you ask, the more you learn about your data, and the more powerful your insights will be.

Asking thorough and specific questions means clarifying details until you get to concrete requirements. With clear requirements and goals, it’s much easier to plan and execute a successful data analysis project and avoid time-consuming problems down the road.
