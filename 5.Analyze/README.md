## 1 Analysis
The process used to make sense of the data collected

The goal of analysis is to identify trends and relationships within data so you can accurately answer the question you're asking

### 1.1 4-phases
- organize data
- Format and adjust data
- Get input from others
- Transform data

### 1.1.1 Sort and filter
Sorting and filtering are two methods you can use to organize, format, and adjust data. 
- Sort: the process of arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.
- Filter: show only the data that meets a specified criteria while hiding the rest.

## 2 Data validation
- Add dropdown lists with predetermined options
- Create custom checkboxes
- Protect structured data and formulas

### 2.1 Types of data validation
- Data type
- Data range
- Data constraints
- Data consistency
- Data structure
- Code validation

## 3 Aggregation
Collecting or gathering many separate pieces into a whole

### 3.1 Data aggregation
Thr process of gathering data from multiple sources in order to combine it into a single summarized collection

#### Spreadsheet: VLOOKUP(Vertical lookup)
A function that searches for a certain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information

#### SQL: Join
- INNER JOIN: a function that returns records with matching values in both tables
- LEFT JOIN: a function that returns all the records from the left table (first mentioned) and only the matching records from the right table (second mentioned)
- RIGHT JOIN: a function that returns all records from the right table (second mentioned) and only the matching records from the left table (first mentioned).
- OUTER JOIN: a function that combines the RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN to return all matching records in both tables.
