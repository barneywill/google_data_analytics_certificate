# Proxy data
Proxy data can often be used to estimate or predict outcomes when actual data is not available. 
Open or public datasets can be used as proxy data sources.

## Scenario 1
A new car model was just launched a few days ago and the auto dealership can’t wait until the end of the month for sales data to come in. They want sales projections now.

### Solution
The analyst proxies the number of clicks to the car specifications on the dealership’s website as an estimate of potential sales at the dealership.

## Scenario 2
A brand new plant-based meat product was only recently stocked in grocery stores and the supplier needs to estimate the demand over the next four years. 

### Solution
The analyst proxies the sales data for a turkey substitute made out of tofu that has been on the market for several years.

## Scenario 3
The Chamber of Commerce wants to know how a tourism campaign is going to impact travel to their city, but the results from the campaign aren’t publicly available yet.

### Solution
The analyst proxies the historical data for airline bookings to the city one to three months after a similar campaign was run six months earlier.

## Scenario 4
A nasal version of a vaccine was recently made available. A clinic wants to know what to expect for contraindications, but just started collecting first-party data from its patients. A contraindication is a condition that may cause a patient not to take a vaccine due to the harm it would cause them if taken. To estimate the number of possible contraindications, a data analyst proxies an open dataset from a trial of the injection version of the vaccine. The analyst selects a subset of the data with patient profiles most closely matching the makeup of the patients at the clinic.
