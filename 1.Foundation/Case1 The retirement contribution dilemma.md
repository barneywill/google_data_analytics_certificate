The management team at a fictional midsized tech company, Geo-Flow, Inc., noticed that employee participation in the company’s retirement contribution program was lower than expected. The company had invested a lot of resources in establishing its world-class benefit program, with the goal of reducing employee turnover. Because so few employees were using the program, leaders wondered if they should develop educational training to explain the benefits to employees. They wanted to make a well-informed decision before committing to the investment, so they asked their data analytics department to make a recommendation. 

The analysts used the six phases framework and began by defining the problem. They asked, “Are employees investing in the company's retirement contribution program?”And, if not, “Should we create an educational program to encourage participation?” Satisfied with their research questions, they prepared their analysis project by gathering data from HR, such as employee demographics, salary levels, and current retirement contributions.

Next, they processed the data by cleaning and organizing it. They removed duplicates and data from individuals who had retired or left the company, then sorted the data by the employees’ ages, departments, and length of employment. Their analysis showed that some employee groups were less likely to contribute to the plan or to be aware that the company offers a matching contribution. They interpreted these results to mean that these employee groups were not receiving enough education on the company’s retirement contribution matching program. They also studied the data to find trends and insights and used data visualization to review their analysis by exploring it in different contexts.

The analysts shared their findings with the management team using visualizations including bar and pie charts that illustrated the facts clearly so decision-makers could easily interpret the data. The report showed that, while overall participation was decent, some employee groups were not taking full advantage of the retirement program—but they might, if they knew more about the program and the matching contribution the company offers. 

Based on these findings, the company took action, creating a targeted educational program focusing on the benefits of retirement contributions, specifically aimed at the employee groups identified as low contributors. Results showed that a few months after implementing this training, there was a significant increase in retirement contributions among the targeted groups.
