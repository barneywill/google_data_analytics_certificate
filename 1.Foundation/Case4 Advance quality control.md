An irrigation company was experiencing an increase in the number of defects in their water pumps. The company's data team used the five whys to analyze the situation:

## 1. “There has been an increase in the number of defects in water pumps. Why?”

To answer this question, the data team set up a meeting with shop floor engineers. They asked for some insights into machine performance and manufacturing processes. After some exploration, it was discovered that the machines used to produce the pumps were not properly calibrated.

## 2. “The machines are not properly calibrated. Why?”

After more brainstorming with the engineering team, it was determined that the machines were miscalibrated during the last maintenance cycle.

## 3. “The machines were miscalibrated during maintenance. Why?”

Next, the data team investigated the procedures involved with machine calibration. They found out that the current method was inappropriate for the machines.

## 4. “The calibration method is inappropriate for the machines. Why?”

This “why” led them to discover that the company had recently installed new software in their machines. Because it was a minor software upgrade, the engineers didn’t realize it would affect calibration. They didn’t have the information they needed to properly calibrate the upgraded machines. 

## 5. “The engineers don’t have the information they need to calibrate the upgraded machines. Why?”

The fifth and final “why” turned up even more evidence: The installation team had upgraded machine software, but had failed to share the corresponding calibration procedures with the engineers. 

So, in this example, the root cause of the problem was that the engineers lacked important information about how to calibrate the machines using the new software system. The solution was found, and the irrigation company was able to implement it right away. Soon, the engineers had the necessary calibration instructions, and the pump defects were eliminated!
